# CVIX_Prediction

This is our senior project: a code repository for predicting the C-VIX index using an LSTM model.

The project is divided into four phases: data collection, sentiment data quantification, LSTM model prediction, and result analysis. Sentiment data quantification is based on the BERT framework, while the LSTM model is implemented using the TensorFlow framework. The repository also includes an earlier version of the LSTM model in Matlab.

The training set prediction results for the entire dataset are as follows:
